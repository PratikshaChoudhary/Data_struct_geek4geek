# Data_struct_geek4geek
So here all this starts, my journey as a programmer. first stop as sujjested by bhaiu bhaiya is NPTEL and geeksforgeeks(DSA). Then leet code, then will let u know when I will face it.
Geeksforgeeks data structure problem solutions- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/


> Array- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-data-structure/

1st problem- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-rotation/
soo irittating, what the hell they have time complexity. made an algo, ofcourse the simplest. then this time complexity sucks, finally somhow got the sol.
1st solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/Timecomplex_array_rotation.cpp

2nd problem- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-array-rotation-continued-reversal-algorithm/
ohh my god, they got more type of complexities, a new one space complexity, hell why, but ok got this one too.
2nd solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/Spacecomplex_array_rotation.cpp

3rd problem- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-cyclically-rotate-array-one/
the biggest idiotic thing they did, first rotate array with time then with space complexities, and now just rotate it by one,kind of time waste, but did this one too.
3rd solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/Cyclic_unit_array_rotation.cpp

4th question- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/
learned a new amazing algo, great idea, was not that big a deal.
4th solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/Binary_search.cpp

5th question- 
ohhhh my ----, what the ----, i mean really!! try something small first yrr, ok took 2 days and somehow got the code running but hell no, not again! that shit- time complexity.
