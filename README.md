Geeksforgeeks data structure problem solutions- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/


> Array- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-data-structure/

1st problem- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-rotation/
soo irittating, what the hell they have time complexity. made an algo, ofcourse the simplest. then this time complexity sucks, finally somhow got the sol.
1st solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/Timecomplex_array_rotation.cpp

2nd problem- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-array-rotation-continued-reversal-algorithm/
ohh my god, they got more type of complexities, a new one space complexity, hell why, but ok got this one too.
2nd solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/Spacecomplex_array_rotation.cpp

3rd problem- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-cyclically-rotate-array-one/
the biggest idiotic thing they did, first rotate array with time then with space complexities, and now just rotate it by one,kind of time waste, but did this one too.
3rd solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/Cyclic_unit_array_rotation.cpp

4th question- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/
learned a new amazing algo, great idea, was not that big a deal.
4th solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/Binary_search.cpp

5th question- https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-series2811/1
I mean really!, extensively simple and I still somehow manajed to waste hours on this one, i am really lazy.
5th solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/Sum_of_first_n_natural_no.cpp

6th question- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/
ohhhh my ----, what the ----, i mean really!! try something small first yrr, ok took 2 days and somehow got the code running but hell no, not again! that very same shit (time complexity). well finally took 3 days for this and here it is.
6th solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/Binary_search_in_rotated_array.cpp

7th question- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-2-inserting-a-node/
this one was not a big deal, just the example are using classes while the problem and the solution is using structure.
7th solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/insertingNodeInLinkedList.cpp

8th question- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-3-deleting-node/
finally!!! feeling like i got the fundamental understanding of link list, the underlying principle of this amazing data structre.
8th solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/deleteNode.cpp

After getting the underlying principle of linkedList i thought to creat a basic structure of linkedList and its basic operation and here it is- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/linkedList.cpp

9th question- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-length-of-a-linked-list-iterative-and-recursive/
just a joke it was, nothing to say.
9th solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/linkListSize.cpp

10th question- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-function-to-get-nth-node-in-a-linked-list/
10th solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/nodeValue.cpp

11th question- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nth-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-list/
11th solution- https://github.com/prathamiitp/Data_struct_geek4geek/blob/master/nodeValueFromLast.cpp
